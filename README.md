Welcome to our School Library platform. Our mission is to make academic resources easily accessible to students and educators. We believe that learning should be engaging, simple, and available to everyone.

This platform provides a digital catalog of books, articles, and academic terms. Whether you're looking for definitions, textbook-style explanations, or AI-generated content to better understand a topic, we’ve got you covered.

Built with ❤️ by the AndroTechlist Group, this application combines technology with education to support students in their academic journey.




This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## About the Project

This project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for building modern web applications using Next.js. It leverages the latest features of Next.js, including server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes, to deliver high-performance and SEO-friendly web experiences.

The project also integrates [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) for font optimization, ensuring a seamless and visually appealing user interface. With its modular structure and developer-friendly tools, this project serves as an excellent starting point for creating dynamic and interactive web applications.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
